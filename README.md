Grade distribution analysis: are CS grades bimodal?

by Elizabeth Patitsas, April 18, 2018

Updates by Ben Swift, June 2020 (<ben.swift@anu.edu.au>)

This is the code I used for the grade analysis study in https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2960310.2960312

Hopefully with the code freely available we can have some replications! :)

## The Data

This repo doesn't contain any actual student data (since there are restrictions
around sharing that stuff). Instead, it contains functionality (in
`fake_data.R`) for generating fake student data with arbitrary mark
distributions.

Out-of-the-box, `fake_data.R` will generate data for the following "fake"
institutions:

* Gauss University, where grades are normal
* Two Humps College, where grades are bimodal
* Neitherton Polytechnic, where grades are neither normal nor bimodal (triangular, to be specific)
* University of Truncation, where grades are normal but the students are all really good and too many of them would get grades above 100, but are truncated down to 100

## Setup

The following R packages are necessary:

- `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- `install.packages("readxl")`
- `install.packages("lubridate")`
- `install.packages("diptest")`
- `install.packages("nortest")`
- `install.packages("moments")`
- `install.packages("triangle")`

## Use

The main script file is `bimodality.R`. It's written in
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) style, and is designed to be run
interactively (although you could run it as a batch job; in that case you can
probably comment out the visualisation code at the end).

### Data input

The `bimodality.R` script assumes that the data for your courses is loaded into
a DataFrame[^tibble] called `data`. Each row of `data` represents **one
student's mark**, and has the following columns:

- `institution` (_character_): the name of the institution
- `year` (_int_): the year the course was taken
- `semester` (_int_): the semester the course was taken in (to help disambiguate
  between courses which run multiple times per year)
- `course` (_int_ or _character_): the course code (or course name; the only
  requirement is that it's a unique identifier for that particular course)
- `mark` (_double_): the student's mark

No other identifying information about the student (e.g. name, student ID) is
required---just the mark.

Here's an example (from the fake data mentioned above)

```R
R> data
# A tibble: 105,600 x 5
# Groups:   institution, year, semester, course [3,520]
   institution          year semester course  mark
   <chr>               <int>    <int>  <int> <dbl>
 1 Gaussian University  2010        1    100  62.0
 2 Gaussian University  2010        1    100  42.6
 3 Gaussian University  2010        1    100  31.2
 4 Gaussian University  2010        1    100  60.7
 5 Gaussian University  2010        1    100  48.7
 6 University of Truncation  2010        1    100  69.4
 7 University of Truncation  2010        1    100  82.4
 8 University of Truncation  2010        1    100  77.5
 9 University of Truncation  2010        1    100  80.8
# â€¦ with 79,190 more rows
```

How you create your `data` is up to you - you could prepare a csv file and use
[`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html), or some
other way.

If you're after an example of how to load & munge an Excel spreadsheet (e.g. an
automated report from your student mark database) into the right shape, then
have a look in anu_preprocessing.R, and modify to taste (that file contains code
that [Ben](https://benswift.me) uses to work with real data from the Australian
National University).

[^tibble]: well, a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) actually

### Analysis

After you've prepared your `data`, the next stage of the script will calculate a
bunch of different statistics (e.g. kurtosis, Hartigan dip test, Shapiro-Wilk)
and put them in a `stats` data frame.

Finally, the script runs the "are my CS grades bimodal?" tests and prints the
results to the R console. They should look something like this:

```R
R> stats %>%
+   group_by(institution) %>%
+   summarise(percent_shapiro_rejected = mean(p_shapiro < 0.05) * 100,
+             percent_dip_test_rejected = mean(kurtosis < 3 & p_dip < 0.05) * 100)
+
# A tibble: 4 x 3
  institution              percent_shapiro_rejected percent_dip_test_rejected
  <chr>                                       <dbl>                     <dbl>
1 Gaussian University                          5.57                     0.114
2 Neitherton Polytechnic                      48.4                      0.909
3 Two Humps University                       100                      100
4 University of Truncation                     4.55                     0.227
```

In terms of interpreting this output:

- `percent_shapiro_rejected` is the number of courses that **are not** normally
  distributed; more precisely it's the percentages of courses where the null
  hypothesis under Shapiro-Wilk (that the data is normally distributed) can be
  rejected at p < 0.05

- `percent_dip_test_rejected` is the number of courses that **are** multimodal;
  more precisely it's the percentages of courses where the kurtosis is less than
  3 _and_ the null hypothesis under the Hartigan dip test (that the data is not
  multimodal) can be rejected at p < 0.05

## Contributing

Sharing real grade data around between institutions is tricky, but having
individuals perform this analysis on the CS marks from their own institution and
sharing the results should be much more do-able. So get on it, and let us know!
